# Xcodes.app

The easiest way to install and switch between multiple versions of Xcode.

_If you're looking for a command-line version of Xcodes.app, try `[xcodes](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes).`_

![CI](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/Xcodes.app/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Installation

Xcodes.app is currently only provided as source code that must be built using Xcode.

## Development

You'll need macOS 11 Big Sur and Xcode 12 in order to build and run Xcodes.app.

Notable design decisions are recorded in [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md). The Apple authentication flow is described in [Apple.paw](./Apple.paw), which will allow you to play with the API endpoints that are involved using the [Paw](https://paw.cloud) app.

[`xcode-install`](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install) and [fastlane/spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship) both deserve credit for figuring out the hard parts of what makes this possible.
